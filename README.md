## Introduction

I'm @theaaronhanks. I'm a student studying Computer Science at Utah State University, and I plan to graduate December of 2023. I am interested in many areas of software development including developing websites and mobile applications.

## Current Employment

I currently work as a Web Development Intern for [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/en/), a service provided by [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng). FamilySearch is an international, nonprofit organization dedicated to helping all people discover their family story through genealogy and making family tree connections. I currently work to help develop the pedigree tree pages.

## Learning

In my current internship I am learning to use React.js. I am also gaining experience working in an Agile Development environment with a small team of software developers. I am learning the processes and architecture involved in maintaining a large codebase.
